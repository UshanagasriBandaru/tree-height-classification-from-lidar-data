Project Objectives
Load and preprocess LiDAR data to extract relevant features.
Develop a 2D grid-based classification system for tree heights.
Visualize raw and processed data for effective interpretation.
Provide a scalable framework for analyzing large-scale LiDAR datasets.


Technologies and Tools Used
Libraries/Frameworks:
laspy: For reading and processing .las files.
Open3D: For handling .pcd point cloud data.
NumPy: For numerical operations and data processing.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For scaling features using MinMaxScaler.


Input Data:
LiDAR.pcd file
LiDAR.las file

Methodology
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
Load .pcd files using Open3D and .las files using laspy.
Extract x, y, z coordinates from the 3D point cloud.
Normalize the coordinates using Min-Max scaling for consistent visualization.
2. Grid-Based Classification
Divide the x, y coordinates into a grid of adjustable size (e.g., 100x100).
Assign the maximum z-value (height) in each grid cell to classify tree heights.
3. Visualization
Scatter Plot: Visualize raw LiDAR data points with height represented by color.
2D Grid Heatmap: Display maximum tree heights for each grid cell.


Results

Input Visualization:
A scatter plot reveals spatial distribution and variations in tree heights, aiding in understanding forest density and structure.
Processed Visualization:
A 2D grid heatmap highlights the tallest tree heights in each cell, enabling ecological assessments and forestry applications.


Challenges and Solutions
Handling Large-Scale Data: Optimized data processing pipeline with grid-based classification to reduce computational complexity.
Noise in LiDAR Data: Applied preprocessing steps to filter outliers and irrelevant points.
Visualizing High-Resolution Data: Scaled data and used intuitive color maps for better interpretation.


Future Work
Expand classification to include tree species or health indicators.
Automate preprocessing for diverse LiDAR datasets.
Implement real-time data processing for dynamic forestry monitoring.
Develop a web-based dashboard for user-friendly visualization and analysis.


Conclusion
This project effectively classifies tree heights using LiDAR data through grid-based classification and visualization techniques. It offers a scalable methodology for forestry management and ecological research, with potential for adaptation to other geographical datasets or features.
